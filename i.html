      In the next lectures, you'll learn about Redux and how to use it. As part
      of these lectures a so-called Redux store will be created with help of a
      function called <code>createStore()</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using that function in your code, you might get a
      <strong>deprecation warning</strong> by your IDE&nbsp;or when running the
      app.
    </p>
    <p><strong>You should ignore this warning!</strong></p>
    <p>You can still use <code>createStore()</code> without issues.</p>
    <p>
      Indeed, the React Redux team now recommends the usage of an extra package
      called <strong>Redux Toolkit</strong> and another way of creating the
      Redux store. That package will
      <strong>indeed be covered a little bit later in the course</strong> as
      well. But by first diving into <code>createStore()</code> and the next
      lectures, you'll learn how Redux works and what it does. This is some
      crucial knowledge that's required no matter if you're then using Redux
      Toolkit (as mentioned:&nbsp;Covered later as well) or not!
